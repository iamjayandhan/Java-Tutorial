### 1. **Problem: Find the First Occurrence of 1 in a Sorted Binary Array** 
### Solution file: BinSearch.java


**Problem Statement**:  
You are given a binary array that contains only 0s and 1s, and the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. Implement an algorithm to find the index of the **first occurrence** of 1 in the array. If 1 is not present in the array, return `-1`.

**Input**:  
- A binary array `arr` of length `n` where each element is either `0` or `1` and the array is sorted.

**Output**:  
- Return the index of the first occurrence of `1`. If there is no `1` in the array, return `-1`.

**Constraints**:  
- The algorithm should run in O(n) time complexity.

**Sample Input**:  
`arr = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`

**Sample Output**:  
`4`

**Preferred:** Binary search!

### 2. **Problem: Implement Bubble Sort**

**Problem Statement**:  
You are required to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm, which is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

**Input**:  
- An array of integers `arr` of length `n` to be sorted.

**Output**:  
- Return the sorted array in non-decreasing order.

**Constraints**:  
- Implement Bubble Sort and show the process of swapping elements until the array is sorted.

**Sample Input**:  
`arr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`

**Sample Output**:  
`[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`
