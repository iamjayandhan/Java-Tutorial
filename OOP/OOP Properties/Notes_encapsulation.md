### 3. Encapsulation

* Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) together into a single unit, typically a class, and restricting direct access to some components.
* Protects the **data and ensures controlled access via getters and setters**
* **Achieved by declaring variables as private and providing public getter and setter methods.**
* **Refer EncapsulationExample.java!**

### Encapsulation VS Data hiding?
Data hiding is the concept of restricting direct access to an object's data or variables to maintain integrity and security. It ensures that critical data is only accessible in controlled ways through methods.

* Achieved using access modifiers like ==***private***==.

### Results
* Prevents external entities from directly modifying the internal state of an object.
* Helps maintain data integrity and prevents unintended changes.
* Promotes security and abstraction by exposing only what's necessary.
* Data hiding is achieved via encapsulation.
