### 3. Encapsulation

* Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) together into a single unit, typically a class, and restricting direct access to some components.
* Protects the data and ensures controlled access via getters and setters
* Achieved by declaring variables as private and providing public getter and setter methods.
