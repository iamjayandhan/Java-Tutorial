### 4. Abstraction

* Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
* Focuses on what an object does, not how it does it.
* Achieved using **abstract classes and interfaces.**
* Methods are declared but not implemented in abstract classes or interfaces.

**example:**
* There are number of things happens even if we use ==**println()**==, we dont care about internal code for that!
* **Refer AbstractionExample.java!**

### Abstraction VS Encapsulation
Abstraction is ***design level***, while encapsulation is ***implementation level***.
***Ex:*** Run a car -> abstraction (we dont care abt total implementation)
How it works -> encapsulation (We care abt total implementation)
