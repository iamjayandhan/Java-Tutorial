### 3. Encapsulation

* Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) together into a single unit, typically a class, and restricting direct access to some components.
* Protects the data and ensures controlled access via getters and setters
* Achieved by declaring variables as private and providing public getter and setter methods.
* **Refer EncapsulationExample.java!**

### 4. Abstraction

* Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
* Focuses on what an object does, not how it does it.
* Achieved using **abstract classes and interfaces.**
* Methods are declared but not implemented in abstract classes or interfaces.

**example:**
* There are number of things happens even if we use ==**println()**==, we dont care about internal code for that!
* **Refer AbstractionExample.java!**
