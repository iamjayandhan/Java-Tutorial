### **Difference Between Abstract Class & Interface in This Scenario**
At first glance, both versions seem to work **exactly the same way**, but there are some key differences in **design philosophy and flexibility**.

## **Key Differences Between Abstract Class & Interface**
| Feature            | **Abstract Class Version** 🏛 | **Interface Version** 🌐 |
|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **Usage**         | Used when there's a partial implementation (i.e., some common behavior) | Used when enforcing a contract (pure abstraction) |
| **Extensibility** | A class can **extend only one** abstract class (single inheritance) | A class can **implement multiple** interfaces (multiple inheritance) |
| **Method Type**   | Can have **both abstract & concrete methods** | **Only abstract methods** (before Java 8) |
| **Variable Type** | Can have instance variables (non-static, non-final) | **Only static & final variables** |
| **Flexibility**   | Less flexible (tied to an inheritance hierarchy) | More flexible (decoupled from class hierarchy) |

### **1️⃣ When Should You Use an Abstract Class?**
Use an **abstract class** when:
- You have **some common implementation** that all subclasses should share.
- You want to **define instance variables** that subclasses can inherit.
- You **don’t need multiple inheritance**.

👉 In your **abstract class version**, `Computer` could have a **common method** like:
```java
abstract class Computer {
    public void powerOn() {
        System.out.println("Powering on...");
    }
    public abstract void code(); 
}
```
This allows **all computers to share behavior**, but still lets each type implement `code()` differently.

---
### **2️⃣ When Should You Use an Interface?**
Use an **interface** when:
- You only need to **define a contract** (what must be implemented, but not how).
- You want to **achieve multiple inheritance** (since Java allows multiple interfaces but only single class inheritance).
- You want to keep your code **more flexible and decoupled**.

👉 In your **interface version**, `Computer` is a pure contract, making it **easy to adapt**:
```java
interface Computer {
    void code(); // No common behavior, just a rule!
}
```
Now, **a class can implement multiple interfaces**, like:
```java
class SmartPhone implements Computer, Camera { 
    public void code() { 
        System.out.println("Coding on mobile...");
    }
    public void capture() {
        System.out.println("Taking photos...");
    }
}
```
💡 This wouldn't be possible with an **abstract class**, since Java **doesn’t allow multiple class inheritance**.

---
## **Final Verdict: Which One to Use?**
✔ Use an **abstract class** if:
   - You have **shared behavior** among all subclasses.
   - You want to **partially implement** some methods.
   - You **don’t need multiple inheritance**.

✔ Use an **interface** if:
   - You just want to **define a contract** (without providing behavior).
   - You need **maximum flexibility** (multiple inheritance).
   - You’re working with a **plugin-like architecture** where different classes can implement the same behavior independently.

---
## **Conclusion 🏆**
🔹 Your **code works fine in both cases** because `Computer` is just an abstraction layer.  
🔹 But, if you **ever** need to make a `Computer` **extend another class** (e.g., `Electronics`), then **interface is the only choice** since Java **doesn’t support multiple class inheritance**.  
🔹 Abstract classes **are more restrictive**, while interfaces **provide better flexibility and decoupling**.

💡 If you're designing for **future scalability**, **prefer interfaces**! 🚀
