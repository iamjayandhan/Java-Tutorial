Given an array of positive integers arr[], return the second largest element from the array. If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.

Note: The second largest element should not be equal to the largest element.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.
Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element is 5.
Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element does not exist.

Constraints:
2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
```

Given an array arr[]. Push all the zeros of the given array to the right end of the array while maintaining the order of non-zero elements. Do the mentioned change in the array in place.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.
Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
```

### 3. Reverse an Array
```
Difficulty: Easy

You are given an array of integers arr[]. Your task is to reverse the given array.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]
Output: [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]
Explanation: The elements of the array are 1 4 3 2 6 5. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is 5 6 2 3 4 1.
Input: arr = [4, 5, 2]
Output: [2, 5, 4]
Explanation: The elements of the array are 4 5 2. The reversed array will be 2 5 4.
Input: arr = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The array has only single element, hence the reversed array is same as the original.

Constraints:
1<=arr.size()<=105
0<=arr[i]<=105
```

### 4. Rotate Array
```

Given an unsorted array arr[]. Rotate the array to the left (counter-clockwise direction) by d steps, where d is a positive integer. Do the mentioned change in the array in place.

Note: Consider the array as circular.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], d = 2
Output: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
Explanation: when rotated by 2 elements, it becomes 3 4 5 1 2.
Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20], d = 3
Output: [8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 2, 4, 6]
Explanation: when rotated by 3 elements, it becomes 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 2 4 6.
Input: arr[] = [7, 3, 9, 1], d = 9
Output: [3, 9, 1, 7]
Explanation: when we rotate 9 times, we'll get 3 9 1 7 as resultant array.

Constraints:
1 <= arr.size(), d <= 105
0 <= arr[i] <= 105
