2. **React JS version** used.
3. **React JS hooks** used.
4. Different **React hooks**, their working, and real-time usage.

12. **Run-time polymorphism - Real-time usage**

18. **REST API - Principles**
19. **Java Inheritance**
20. **React State Propagation:**
    - **Scenario:** Two components:  
      - Component 1 has `useState`.  
      - Component 1 passes state to Component 2 via props.  
      - Component 2 now has its own `useState`.  
      - If **Component 1's state changes**, how will both components re-render?
