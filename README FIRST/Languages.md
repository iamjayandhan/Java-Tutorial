Programming languages can be categorized into different types based on their paradigms (styles of programming). Here are some common types:  

### 1. **Procedural Languages**  
   - Follow step-by-step instructions (procedures) to solve a problem.  
   - Use functions or procedures to structure code.  
   - Examples:  
     - C  
     - Pascal  
     - Fortran  
     - BASIC  

### 2. **Object-Oriented Languages (OOP)**  
   - Use objects and classes to organize code.  
   - Follow principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
   - Examples:  
     - Java  
     - C++  
     - Python (supports OOP)  
     - C#  

### 3. **Functional Languages**  
   - Focus on pure functions and immutability.  
   - Avoid changing state or modifying variables.  
   - Examples:  
     - Haskell  
     - Lisp  
     - Scala  
     - Elixir  

### 4. **Scripting Languages**  
   - Used for automation, web development, and scripting tasks.  
   - Often interpreted rather than compiled.  
   - Examples:  
     - JavaScript  
     - Python  
     - PHP  
     - Ruby  

### 5. **Logic Programming Languages**  
   - Based on formal logic and rule-based programming.  
   - Used in AI and problem-solving.  
   - Examples:  
     - Prolog  
     - Datalog  

### 6. **Markup Languages (Not Programming Languages but Used for Structuring Data)**  
   - Define document structure and presentation.  
   - Examples:  
     - HTML  
     - XML
