###  Excption Handling

In Java there exists a class that handles all errors and exceptions -> Throwable class

Here,
1. Main class => **Object class**
2. **Throwable class** => Inherited from Object class
3. Has **Exceptions and Errors**
   
### Types of Exceptions
1. **Checked** => Exceptions are checked during compile time!
2. **Unchecked** => Checked only in runtime.

### Terminologies
1. **try** => Experimental code is dropped here in this block.
2. **catch** => handle any kind of exceptions
3. **finally** => This block is always gets executed.

### throw vs throws
1. **throw** => throw an exception.
2. **throws** => declare exceptions(tells java that the method may/may not throw an exception!)
